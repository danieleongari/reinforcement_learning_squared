Based on the Chapter 18 of the book 
[Hands-On Machine Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/).

One can find all the original code in the 
[GitHub repository associated to the book](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/18_reinforcement_learning.ipynb).

Note that in this repository examples are implemented in stand-alone python programs, usually plotting interactive visualization on screen.
